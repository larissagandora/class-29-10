## About the project

ðŸ’» A small React project that fetches and displays a list of users from the JSONPlaceholder API, showing their name, email, username, phone, and website.
ðŸ§  Built as part of my course activity to practice useState, useEffect, and API integration in React.
ðŸŽ¨ The CSS can be customized freely â€” feel free to give it your own style!
